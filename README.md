## About

This is an web application with which you can write to yourself how you feel when you feel it. The ideia is that you shouldn't have wait to describe your feelings and emotions, to your therapist or even a friend, so write them right on the moment and don't loose any detail. The app will compile all your reports and save them for whenever you want to revisit them. Also, to help you see a big picture of mental and physical health, it will automactically create a few charts based on what you are sharing. Below are the implemented features:

- Sign Up
- Login
- Quickly pick your major mood for today
- See the information we have recently gathered from your past reports on the homepage
- Add a report, whriting down whatever you want and selecting, emotions and symptoms from a our list
- Check your history for a complete collection of your reports, moods and the charts we provide, filtering by last week, last month, last year or all time

By using this app you will never again miss your feelings by waiting to long to externalize them.
